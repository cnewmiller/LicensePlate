# LicensePlate
A solver for a license plate matching game

There's a road trip game I played as a kid where you see a license plate with three letters and you try to think of a word with those three letters in that order, the closer together the better.

Well, I was playing this game recently and thought of a way of constructing a data structure to solve this kind of problem.

It takes an array of chars (say, ['f', 'h', 'y']) and comes back with all the words in its dictionary file with those letters in that order.
